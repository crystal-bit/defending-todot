**Defending Todot** it's an open source tower defense game inspired by Kingdom Rush.  

It's a fork of [crystal-bit/hacktoberfest-2020](https://github.com/crystal-bit/hacktoberfest-2020) made to continue the development of the game after the event.

The project is made with the open source [Godot Engine v3.2.3](https://godotengine.org).

## Project conventions

### Lower case letters only for filenames

To avoid issues when multiple contributors are working on the same project across various
file systems and operating systems. See more details [here](https://github.com/crystal-bit/godot-game-template#lower-case-letters-only).

### Node names

Use `CamelCase` style for node names.  
This is the default style used in Godot and, moreover, it's easier to reference node names which don't have dash symbol or whitespaces in their name (see [this comment](https://github.com/crystal-bit/hacktoberfest-2020/pull/21#issuecomment-703162481))

### Code style

There are no strict requirements on code style, but try to be consistent with the code that you'll find.

Ideally the code should follow [the official GDScript style guide](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).

For the order of variables, signals, functions, please follow this order (simplified from [GDQuest's guidelines](https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/guidelines/godot-gdscript/#in-short)):

```
1.  Extends and class_name
2.  """docstring"""

3.  Signals
4.  Node dependencies
5.  Constants
6.  Variables (properties)

7.  Built-in virtual callbacks (eg: \_ready, \_input, \_process, ...)
8.  Signal callbacks (eg: on_button_pressed, on_area_entered, on_body_entered, ...)
9.  Methods
```
